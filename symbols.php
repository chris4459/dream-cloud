            <h5>Animal</h5>
            <div class = "symbolMeaning"> <p> Animals often represent the part of your psyche that feels connected to nature and survival. Being chased by a predator suggests you're holding back repressed emotions like fear or aggression.

        </div>

            </p> </div>
            
            <h5>Clothes</h5>
            <div class = "symbolMeaning"> <p> Clothes make a statement about how we want people to perceive us. If your dream symbol is shabby clothing, you may feel unattractive or worn out. Changing what you wear may reflect a lifestyle change.

            <h5>Cross</h5>

            </p> </div>
            <h5>Demons</h5>
            <div class = "symbolMeaning"> <p> Demons are sneaky evil entities which signify repressed emotions. You may secretly feel the need to change your behaviors for the better.

            <h5>Food</h5>
            <div class = "symbolMeaning"> <p> Food is said to symbolize knowledge, because it nourishes the body just as information nourishes the brain. However, it could just be food.

        <div id = "H">
            <h4>H</h4>
            <h5>Hair</h5>
            <div class = "symbolMeaning"> <p> Hair has significant ties with sexuality, according to Freud. Abundant hair may symbolize virility, while cutting hair off in a dream shows a loss of libido. Hair loss may also express a literal fear of going bald.
