			<h2>Why Do We Dream?</h2>
			<p>Dreams are a communication of body, mind and spirit in a symbolic communicative environmental state of being. That's it! Now that you are thoroughly confused let me explain in a more down to earth language. Our brains are in constant activity. Different states of consciousness (like awake, asleep, alert, drowsy, excited, bored, concentrating or daydreaming) cause different brain wave activity. Our conscious mind, or the part we think with, our "window" into life, only takes up a very small portion of our brain activity. (some say this is only 10%) Other areas control things like breathing, heartbeat, converting light to vision, sound to hearing, balance when we walk, etc. etc. This too has it's own percentage (small). Another area controls imagination. This area is widely an undiscovered frontier. Imagination is more then dreaming of a new car or picturing someone with their cloths off! When you look at clouds and see shapes, or wood grain and see images, this is the "order from chaos" part of your imagination. The mind cannot deal with chaos very well, in fact it will resist it and sometimes manufacture order. (very important to the dreaming process.)This too occupies a small percentage of brian activity. Then there is memory. Memory is vast! And I believe it occupies more of the brains resources then most people believe. And then there is the activity called dreaming. I think that to a certain extent, we dream all the time. Even while awake! But the process is functioning in our subconscious mind, out of view from our "window". If defined precisely, they may not be referred to as dreams technically, but the activity is very closely related. During certain cycles of brain activity while asleep, we can "view" these dreams with our conscious mind and record them in our memory.</p>

			<p>Your longest and most memorable lucid dreams will usually occur in the fourth and fifth sleep cycles (after about six hours of sleep) during phases of REM sleep. Critically, during these later sleep cycles, periods of REM sleep become longer.</p>

	    	<h2>The Stages of Sleep</h2>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>
	    			NREM Stage 1 is a light sleep and you are easily woken. You begin to lose muscle tone, causing twitches and hypnic jerks (suddenly jumping awake from a doze). You have hypnagogic hallucinations, swirling light and color patterns which hypnotize your mind into a restful sleep. Stage 1 also marks the loss of self-awareness and most sensory attachment to the physical world. Your brainwave frequencies descend from Alpha through Theta state (4-7 Hz).
	    		</li>
	    		<li>
	    			NREM Stage 2 is marked by a loss of nearly all muscle tone so your physical body can't act out your forthcoming dreams. Although your brainwaves have slowed further, they do show brief bursts of higher brainwave activity called sleep spindles and K-complexes. You spend around half of all your sleep in Stage 2; a light dreamless sleep.
	    		</li>
	    		<li>
	    			NREM Stage 3 (*and 4, as these stages have now been merged together) is also called slow-wave sleep (SWS), consisting of unconscious delta activity. The sleeper is less responsive to the environment and most stimuli cause no reaction. If you are woken you will feel especially dopey and confused for a couple of minutes. Another dreamless stage of sleep, it is (perhaps surprisingly) the most likely time for sleepwalking to occur.
	    		</li>
	    		<li>
	    			REM marks the onset of dreaming. This stage is also known as paradoxical sleep because the sleeper, though showing more active brainwaves than before, is harder to awaken. If you are awoken from REM sleep you are more likely to jump right back in during a later nap. Though its functions are not fully understood, we do know that REM deprivation impairs our ability to learn complex tasks and form long term memories.
